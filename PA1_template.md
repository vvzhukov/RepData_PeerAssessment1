This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring
device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the
day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous
individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and
include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site:

-   Dataset: [Activity monitoring
    data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip)

The variables included in this dataset are:

steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are
coded as 𝙽𝙰) </br> date: The date on which the measurement was taken in
YYYY-MM-DD format </br> interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval
in which measurement was taken </br> The dataset is stored in a
comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568
observations in this dataset.

Loading and preprocessing the data
----------------------------------

Unzip data to obtain a csv file.

    fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
    download.file(fileUrl, destfile = paste0(getwd(), '/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip'), method = "curl")
    unzip("repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",exdir = "data")

Reading csv Data into Data.Table.
---------------------------------

    library("data.table")
    activityDT <- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")

What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
-------------------------------------------------

1.  Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

<!-- -->

    Total_Steps <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, sum, na.rm = FALSE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 

    head(Total_Steps, 10)

    ##           date steps
    ##  1: 2012-10-01    NA
    ##  2: 2012-10-02   126
    ##  3: 2012-10-03 11352
    ##  4: 2012-10-04 12116
    ##  5: 2012-10-05 13294
    ##  6: 2012-10-06 15420
    ##  7: 2012-10-07 11015
    ##  8: 2012-10-08    NA
    ##  9: 2012-10-09 12811
    ## 10: 2012-10-10  9900

1.  Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.

<!-- -->

    library(ggplot2)
    ggplot(Total_Steps, aes(x = steps)) +
        geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) +
        labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")

    ## Warning: Removed 8 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).

![](PA1_template_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

1.  Mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

<!-- -->

    Total_Steps[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE), Median_Steps = median(steps, na.rm = TRUE))]

    ##    Mean_Steps Median_Steps
    ## 1:   10766.19        10765

What is the average daily activity pattern?
-------------------------------------------

1.  Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval
    (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all
    days (y-axis)

<!-- -->

    IntervalDT <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval)] 

    ggplot(IntervalDT, aes(x = interval , y = steps)) + geom_line(color="blue", size=1) + labs(title = "Avg. Daily Steps", x = "Interval", y = "Avg. Steps per day")

![](PA1_template_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

1.  Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the
    dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

<!-- -->

    IntervalDT[steps == max(steps), .(max_interval = interval)]

    ##    max_interval
    ## 1:          835

Imputing missing values
-----------------------

1.  Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the
    dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)

<!-- -->

    nrow(activityDT[is.na(steps),])

    ## [1] 2304

1.  Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the
    dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For
    example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for
    that 5-minute interval, etc.

<!-- -->

    # Filling in missing values with median of dataset. 
    activityDT[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]

1.  Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with
    the missing data filled in.

<!-- -->

    data.table::fwrite(x = activityDT, file = "data/tidyData.csv", quote = FALSE)

1.  Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and
    calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken
    per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first
    part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data
    on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

<!-- -->

    # total steps taken per day
    Total_Steps <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, sum)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 

    # mean and median total steps taken per day
    Total_Steps[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps), Median_Steps = median(steps))]

    ##    Mean_Steps Median_Steps
    ## 1:    9354.23        10395

    ggplot(Total_Steps, aes(x = steps)) + geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) + labs(title = "Steps per day", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")

Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels –
    “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday
    or weekend day.

<!-- -->

    # Just recreating activityDT from scratch  
    activityDT <- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")
    activityDT[, date := as.POSIXct(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")]
    activityDT[, `Day of Week`:= weekdays(x = date)]
    activityDT[grepl(pattern = "Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekday"
    activityDT[grepl(pattern = "Saturday|Sunday", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekend"
    activityDT[, `weekday or weekend` := as.factor(`weekday or weekend`)]
    head(activityDT, 10)

    ##     steps       date interval Day of Week weekday or weekend
    ##  1:    NA 2012-10-01        0      Monday            weekday
    ##  2:    NA 2012-10-01        5      Monday            weekday
    ##  3:    NA 2012-10-01       10      Monday            weekday
    ##  4:    NA 2012-10-01       15      Monday            weekday
    ##  5:    NA 2012-10-01       20      Monday            weekday
    ##  6:    NA 2012-10-01       25      Monday            weekday
    ##  7:    NA 2012-10-01       30      Monday            weekday
    ##  8:    NA 2012-10-01       35      Monday            weekday
    ##  9:    NA 2012-10-01       40      Monday            weekday
    ## 10:    NA 2012-10-01       45      Monday            weekday

1.  Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of
    the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps
    taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).
    See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of
    what this plot should look like using simulated data.

<!-- -->

    activityDT[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]
    IntervalDT <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval, `weekday or weekend`)] 

    ggplot(IntervalDT , aes(x = interval , y = steps, color=`weekday or weekend`)) + geom_line() + labs(title = "Avg. Daily Steps by Weektype", x = "Interval", y = "No. of Steps") + facet_wrap(~`weekday or weekend` , ncol = 1, nrow=2)
